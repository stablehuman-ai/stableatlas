<h1 style="text-align: center;">StableAtlas</h1>

Stable-Atlas is a free and open source project that seeks to outline the relationship between Stable-Playground, Stable-Human, Stable-Concept and others. In order to provide a clear structure and methodology for development and adoption. 

Within, detailed instructions are provided for the creation of an automated pipeline to develop training data for AI. From large language models to SOTA vision and other multimodal blahblahblah.

Data

The three cornerstones of AI are, hardware, alogorithms and data. This project seeks to expand on possible solutions to solving some of the challenges of  data. More focused on the data itself rather than the physical constraints of storage or serving of said data. 

This project is a high level approach to the tracking and generation of the data itself. By systematically classifying data and using said structure to find where there is abscense we are able to automatically generate where there is need. Thus creating highly efficient training datasets or supplying large datasets that may be missing fundamental aspects with the information needed to correct.

By tracking this data we gain control of what is taught to AI models. In depth understanding of what goes in allows us fine tune and gain control over the outcomes of training.
